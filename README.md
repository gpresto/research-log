# research-log
template to generate parameterized research log

1. Open ~/R/01_date-parameters.R and change start and end to desired parameters. Run script.
2. Open ~/R/03_iterate-weeks.R and run script as is
3. Open ~/R/04_index.Rmd and knit


### To Fix

* handle NA values that are in the same calendar week but outside the start-end dates. Currently manual deletion from output .Rmd files generated by 03_iterate-weeks.R

* remove "," that appear in the last week entry and between weeks (where is this generated from?)
